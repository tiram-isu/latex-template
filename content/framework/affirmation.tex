\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Declaration on Honest Academic Work}

With this document, Ideclare that I have drafted and created the piece of work
in hand myself. I declare that I have only used such aids as are permissible and used no other sources
or aids than the ones declared. I furthermore assert that any passages used, whether verbatim or
paraphrased, have been cited in accordance with current academic citation rules and such passages
have been marked accordingly. Additionally, I declare that I have disclosed and stated all uses of
any aids such as AI-based chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT), translation tools (e.g., DeepL), paraphrasing
tools (e.g., Quillbot), or programming devices (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and have marked any relevant
passages accordingly.
\\
\\
I am aware that the use of machine-generated texts does not guarantee the quality of their content
or the text as a whole. I assert that I used text-generating AI tools merely as an aid and that the
piece of work in hand is, for the most part, the result of my creative input. I am entirely responsible
for the use of any machine-generated passages of text I have used.
I also confirm that I have taken note of the document “Satzung der Hochschule Furtwangen (HFU)
zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis” dated October 27, 2022, and that I have followed
the statements therein.
\\
\\
I am aware that my work may be examined to determine whether any non-permissible aids or
plagiarism were used. I also acknowledge that a breach of § 10 or § 11 sections 4 and 5 of HFU’s
study and examination regulations’ general part may lead to a grade of 5 or “nicht ausreichend”
(not sufficient) for the work in question and/or exclusion from any further examinations.
